# Dparlor - Star Wars Data Model

Welcome to the Dparlor Star Wars Data Model project! This project provides a comprehensive data model for the Star Wars universe, designed to enhance your understanding of data modeling and improve your coding skills.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to increase your coding ability and knowledge by providing a hands-on experience with data modeling. You will learn how to structure data effectively and create relationships between different entities in the Star Wars universe.

## Features

- A well-defined data model representing various Star Wars entities such as characters, planets, starships, and vehicles.
- Clear relationships between entities to illustrate how they interact within the Star Wars universe.
- Documentation to guide you through the data model and its components.
- Built with modern data modeling practices for better understanding and learning.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Dparlor Star Wars Data Model project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of data modeling concepts.
- Familiarity with JavaScript and JSON.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dabeldab/dparlor-miamipt78-starwars-data-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dparlor-miamipt78-starwars-data-model
   ```
